Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. By analyzing patterns in historical data, machine learning models can make predictions, detect anomalies, classify objects, and even generate new content. It powers many everyday applications, from recommendation systems on streaming platforms to fraud detection in banking.

There are several types of machine learning, including supervised learning (where models learn from labeled data), unsupervised learning (which identifies patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (where agents learn by interacting with an environment to maximize a reward). As the field continues to grow, it plays an increasingly central role in fields such as healthcare, finance, robotics, and natural language processing.
